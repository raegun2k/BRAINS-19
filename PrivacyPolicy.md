# Privacy Policy
BRAINS-19 is a Free extension. It is provided by Rae O'Neil at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This document is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.

If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

I do not collect any information via this extension. It should only be affecting the page within browser and not sending any of that information to any third party. If you notice any such information being shared, it is either by another extension or via ad tracking on the visited page, over which I have no control. If you do notice this extension sending any information, please open an issue at https://github.com/raegun2k/BRAINS-19 and I will get to the bottom of it.

Your privacy is important and this is just a silly extension. I have no intention of collecting data from you.

The extension will slurp the content of all visited webpages in order to affectuate the intended manipulations, but none of this will be transferred away.

The extension will also acquire a Google hosted webfont. In doing so, Google's servers will be made aware of your IP. No other information will be transferred to them from this extension aside from which font to load.

## Childrenâ€™s Privacy

These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to do necessary actions.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.

## Contact Me

If you have any questions or suggestions about my Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact me at https://github.com/raegun2k/BRAINS-19.
