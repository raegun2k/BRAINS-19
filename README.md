# BRAINS-19

Replaces mentions of COVID-19 or Coronavirus on a webpage with "Zombie Apocalypse" or "Zombie Infection" instead.

It's a very simple extension done quickly by someone who never made one. 

Suggested by one Sarah Sawler on Twitter(https://twitter.com/SarahSawler/status/1238092065864585217) to lighten
the thick atmosphere with a bit of dark zombie humour.

THis has been submitted to the Chrome Web Store for review, but in the mean time, you can install this in your browser via sideload(at your own risk!) by:

 * Open Extensions under the "More Tools" section of the ':' menu in Chrome
 * Activate Developer Mode with the little toggle in the top right.
 * "Load Unpacked" button at the top. Navigate to the folder you cloned/downloaded this extension to. Click to select folder.
 
Enable or disable the effects of the extension by clicking the little biohazard extension icon.
